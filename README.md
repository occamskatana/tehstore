				TehStore

Description

Tehstore is a store web application that allows users who are travelling in remote areas of the world to post items that they see for sale in local speciality shops to the store with their own margin built in. Fulfillers then take the orders they get, buy them, and ship them to the client, without the original "vendor" ever having to take on product or go out of pocket. The original vendor then can make money while travelling and potentially subsidize whole trips. Tehstore will take a cut of the set margin to pay Fulfillers and, obviously, make money.
